<p><h3>The origins of Haute Couture are attributed to Charles Frederick Worth who in 1858 founded the first true Couture House at number 7, rue de la Paix in Paris. Before that Rose Bertin, Marie-Antoinette&#039s &laquo Fashion Minister &raquo had foreshadowed it, being the first to start freeing up the female body, all the while adorning her creations with embroidery, lace and rose petals.</h3></p></th></tr>

<tr><th id="th2"><p><h3>Following a decision taken on January 23rd 1945, the designation &laquo Haute Couture &raquo became a legally registered designation of origin.</h3></p></th></tr>

<tr><th id="th2"><p><h3>Only those houses and companies that are approved each year by a dedicated commission run by the Chambre Syndicale de la Couture and held under the aegis of the Ministry for Industry may become eligible for it.</h3></p></th></tr>
